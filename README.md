# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aria (Yiran Gong)



I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Cognitive Science** at **Barnard College of Columbia University**, passionate about using data to build thoughtful, human-centered solutions.  
As a researcher, leader, and collaborator, I’m driven by curiosity, clarity, and a strong commitment to equity and inclusion. My work lives at the intersection of data, behavior, and impact.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 📊 **[Modeling Communication Dynamics in Complex Strategic Planning: A Unity-Based Behavioral Experiment]**  
_

Led the design and pilot of a behavioral experiment to study how communication influences strategic planning in complex environments. Developed a custom Unity game to simulate decision trees with asymmetric rewards and collected multi-modal data (game logs, audio transcripts, cursor movement). Applied data science methods to preprocess behavioral data, design comparative conditions, and structure future analyses on performance, coordination patterns, and communication dynamics.

**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib,  Unity (C#)
