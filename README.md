# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aria (Yiran Gong)

![aria-profile](path/to/your/image.png)

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Cognitive Science** at **Barnard College of Columbia University**, passionate about using data to build thoughtful, human-centered solutions.  
As a researcher, leader, and collaborator, I’m driven by curiosity, clarity, and a strong commitment to equity and inclusion. My work lives at the intersection of data, behavior, and impact.
